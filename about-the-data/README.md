# About the data

In our pipeline we probably have to deal with data difficulties. Maybe the data is on a different location or even a different server. Maybe our data needs to be searched on genetic databases. Maybe there is not enough capacity to store all your data on a local machine. During the project you find out that you want to use more samples and you do not want to recode your entire script. This topic is about the data. **Flexible, configurable** and **remote data** will be discussed.
