# Why use SnakeMake

Nowadays snakemake is used more and more for bioinformatics pipelines.

We will work with snakemake because it has several advantages comparing with a bash script

* it is based on Python
* open source
* designed with bioinformatics in mind
* easy to offload processes to cluster nodes
* can handle multiple input and output files
* many bonus features: configuration, graphs of workflows, logreports
* only executes parts that are not processed before

## Why parallelization matters
