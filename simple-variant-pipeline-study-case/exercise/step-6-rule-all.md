# Step 6: rule all

To finish the script we need a `rule all`. The `rule all:` is basically the entry point of the script using the final output file as input which will trigger the entire chain of rules.

Finish the script by

* adding a rule all
* Add a message to every rule
* Create a dag file of the entire script

Test the script. Upload your script, the dag and the final output file in your repository.

Deactivate the environment is you are finished.
